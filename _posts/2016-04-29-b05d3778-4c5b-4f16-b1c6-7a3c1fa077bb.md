# Off I Go

I feel totally stone cold sober when I close the back hatch on everything important enough to take with me most of which is plain lunacy in its botched perception of what I'll actually be up for over the next 30-60 days(!!!!). But we always think it's gonna be a certain way, we travelers of this worlds best institutions of bringing the minus ones up to zero with a chance to start again. And it never is. These things we take with us are basically just totems to some life we'd let slip away and they comprise just the only things we could rescue from the flash flood of self destruction that just washed our lives away. So I take a little guitar amp with me. No guitar. Just this little orange Fender Champ I'd made from soup to nuts around a clock(s) fueled by dope. Needless to say it never even gets plugged in. So yeah, I feel totally sober but the combination of all the chemicals and no sleep is surely giving my driver, some nice kid named Uri an utterly different perspective. But so what. I give him directions out of Eagle Rock and we chat about stuff. It kills the time.
